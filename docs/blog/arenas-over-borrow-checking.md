# Choosing Arenas Over Borrow Checking

**Published:** June 2026 | **Reading time:** 13 minutes

Here is a dangling pointer bug:

```c
int* create_dangling() {
    int x = 42;
    return &x;  // x dies when the function returns
}
```

C compiles this with a warning. Rust rejects it at compile time via
the borrow checker. Salt rejects it at compile time without one.

Salt has no lifetime annotations. No `'a`, no `Box<dyn Future>`, no
`Arc<Mutex<T>>`. Despite this, it catches the bug above, plus
cross-lifetime stores and use-after-reset — all at compile time.

How? Arenas.

## Arenas: Allocate, Use, Reset

An arena is a fixed-size memory region with a bump pointer. Allocation
moves the pointer forward. Resetting moves it back to the start.
Everything in the arena lives together and dies together.

```salt
let arena = Arena::new(4096);   // 4KB region
let x = arena.alloc(42);       // bump pointer moves forward
let y = arena.alloc(99);       // bump pointer moves again
// ... use x and y ...
arena.reset();                  // everything freed at once, O(1)
```

There is no `free(x)`. No per-object deallocation. No fragmentation.
No free list. The allocator is four instructions: load current pointer,
add size, compare against limit, store new pointer.

This is the same model video games have used for decades. A frame
starts, everything allocates from the frame arena, the frame ends, the
arena resets. No individual deallocations. No memory leaks. No garbage
collector pauses.

The tradeoff: individual objects can't outlive their arena. If you need
a value to live longer, you allocate it in a longer-lived arena or copy
it out.

## The Scope Ladder: Escape Analysis Without Annotations

The arena model works because Salt proves, at compile time, that no
arena pointer outlives its arena. This is the Scope Ladder.

Every variable gets an integer depth based on its lexical scope:

| Depth | Example |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Module-level globals |
| 1 | Function arguments (outlive the body) |
| 2 | Function-local variables |
| 3+ | Block-scoped variables (`if`/`while`/`for`) |

Arena pointers inherit the depth of the arena they were allocated from.
Three rules govern all assignments and returns:

**Rule 1: Return Rule.** `return x` is valid only if `depth(x) <= 1`.
You can't return a pointer into a local arena.

```salt
fn create_dangling() -> Ptr<Node> {
    let arena = Arena::new(4096);   // depth 2 (local)
    let n = arena.alloc(Node{});    // depth 2 (inherits)
    return n;                       // ❌ depth 2 > 1 — compile error
}
```

**Rule 2: Assignment Rule.** `a = b` requires `depth(b) <= depth(a)`.
You can't store a short-lived pointer in a long-lived container.

```salt
fn store_escape(bucket: &Bucket) {
    let arena = Arena::new(4096);   // depth 2
    let n = arena.alloc(Node{});    // depth 2
    bucket.node = n;                // ❌ depth(bucket) ≤ 1 — compile error
}
```

**Rule 3: Transitivity.** `s.field` inherits `depth(s)`. If you can't
store `x` in `s`, you can't store `x` in `s.field` either.

Three rules. No annotations. The compiler infers depths from the AST and
checks every assignment and return statement during codegen.

## What the Scope Ladder Catches

| Bug | Example | Caught by |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| Dangling return | Return pointer to local arena | Rule 1 (compile time) |
| Cross-lifetime store | Store local pointer in outer struct | Rule 2 (compile time) |
| Use-after-reset | Read after `arena.reset()` | Debug layer (runtime) |

The compile-time checks have zero runtime cost — they're AST analysis,
not codegen. Use-after-reset is caught at runtime in debug builds
(`SALT_DEBUG`) via poison fills: `arena.reset()` fills the freed region
with `0xAA`, and any subsequent read through a dangling pointer hits the
poison value and traps. Same technique as ASAN's use-after-free
detection, scoped to arena boundaries.

Z3 epoch tracking is enforced at compile time via the `ArenaVerifier`:
pointers carry the epoch of their allocation, and the compiler proves
the pointer's epoch matches the arena's current epoch before each
dereference. Use-after-reset and epoch violations are rejected at
compile time. The debug poison-fill layer provides a runtime backstop
in debug builds.

## When Arenas Don't Work

Arenas work when your allocation pattern is: allocate many objects, use
them for a bounded period, free them all at once. This describes request
handlers, frame renderers, compiler passes, and kernel operations.

Arenas don't work for:

- **Arbitrary graph structures with independent lifetimes.** A DOM tree
  where nodes are created and destroyed independently needs either a GC
  or manual memory management.
- **Long-lived caches.** If objects live for minutes or hours, an arena
  that can't be reset until the last object dies wastes memory.
- **Cyclic references.** Arenas don't collect cycles. If A points to B
  and B points to A, both live until the arena resets.

For these cases, Salt provides `Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>` — reference-counted
heap allocation. Slower than arenas, but handles the general case. The
convention: use arenas by default, reach for `Rc` only when you need
independent lifetimes.

## Why Arenas Over Borrow Checking

A Rust function with arena-allocated return values:

```rust
fn create_node<'a>(arena: &'a Arena, val: i32) -> &'a Node {
    arena.alloc(Node { val })
}
```

The equivalent Salt:

```salt
fn create_node(arena: Arena, val: i32) -> Ptr<Node> {
    return arena.alloc(Node { val });
}
```

Rust requires an explicit lifetime parameter `'a` on the function, the
argument, and the return type. Salt infers it from the depth of `arena`
(depth 1, because it's an argument) and propagates it to the return
value.

Rust's borrow checker is more expressive. It handles partial borrows,
non-lexical lifetimes, and complex ownership graphs that the Scope
Ladder can't express. For a general-purpose systems language, that
expressiveness is essential.

Salt isn't general-purpose. It's for kernels, network servers, and
compilers — programs where allocation patterns are simple and
predictable. In those domains, arenas handle ~90% of cases with zero
annotations. For the remaining 10%, there's `Rc<T>` and `unsafe`.

The trade is real: Salt can't express the ownership patterns Rust can.
But for the kernel, the network stack, and the compiler, it doesn't
need to.

## The Bottom Line

Arenas aren't a new idea. They're used in video games, compilers, and
every high-performance system where allocation patterns are predictable.
What Salt adds is compile-time escape analysis that makes them safe by
default — no annotations, no runtime overhead, no borrow checker.

Three rules. Zero annotations. The compiler catches the bugs before the
binary exists.
