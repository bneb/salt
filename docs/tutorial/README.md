# Salt by Example

A hands-on introduction to the Salt programming language. Each chapter builds on the previous one and includes runnable code examples.

## How to Use This Tutorial

Follow the chapters in order. Every code sample is a complete, compilable Salt program — copy it into a `.salt` file and run it:

```bash
salt-front my_program.salt -o my_program && ./my_program
```

Or use the package manager:

```bash
sp new my_project && cd my_project
# Edit src/main.salt with the example code
sp run
```

## Prerequisites

Run `make setup` (or `./scripts/bootstrap.sh`) from the repository root to install dependencies and build the compiler. You need LLVM 21, Z3 4.12+, and Rust 1.75+.
